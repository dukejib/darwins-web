We have to demonstrate first. But in the meantime while we are reviewing the statements, we encourage you to carefully review the 87 question self-assessment test that appears in the next section  <a href="{{ route('aboutbusiness') }}"><strong>About Business</strong></a> You will quickly realize that with the proper expert guidance behind you, your retail or professional service business can very quickly - and probably dramatically - multiply with the number of sales you generate. The results that your marketing and advertising produces in the size and kind of sales you will generate, will manifest the number of prospects and buyers you get, and the frequency they come back.
